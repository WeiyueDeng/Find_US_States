# Find_US_States
Mini project: Use Vue.js for the front-end, the data used for autocomplete is filtered via GraphQL. There is also an embedded google map which shows the whole USA at first and will show different states according to users' input.

To run the app:
1. First, run the backend_GraphQL folder, use command line: node index.js 
   NOTE: The GraphQL Endpoint might be different. If so, edit the corresponding link to the correct one.
   
3. Then, after the data needed is ready, run the frontend folder, use command line: npm run dev
   NOTE: As there is an embedded google map imported in the app, we need to add our GOOGLE MAP API KEY in the corresponding links(links for google map)              before we run the app. Otherwise, the map won't work.
